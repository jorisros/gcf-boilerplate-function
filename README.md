# Google cloud boilerplate
I created this project to use as boilerplate and reference to setup new Google Functions with PHP.

## Usage
- Download this project as zip
- Change the Names
    - composer.json (name; autoload.psr-4)
    - modify the ``config/dependency_injection.php``
- Create git repository and push to it
- While I am using symfony components the injection is done manually

## Run tests
```bash
php vendor/bin/phpunit tests
```
